# 🔦 2D Raycasting with p5.js

This repository contains a JavaScript project that demonstrates 2D raycasting using the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. The simulation runs in the browser and creates a canvas where rays interact with walls in a scene, mimicking the basic principles of light and visibility.
